# Intent

Made this repository just for showing some skill and use of basilar typescript. This isn't a main project and is only for the purpose of fun. I used the dev-container only to just prove it. All the structure and major of file of this repository are from the vite+ typescript template of Phaser, you can found on this [link](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-vite-ts.git).

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `index.html` - A basic HTML page to contain the game.
- `src` - Contains the game source code.
- `src/main.ts` - The main **entry** point. This contains the game configuration and starts the game.
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Global TypeScript declarations, provide types information.
- `src/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `public/style.css` - Some simple CSS rules to help with page layout.
